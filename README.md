# The data Science Question:

Can I use NLP to be able to differentiate between r/TheOnion and r/nottheonion? 

# Models

I tried to use Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF and compared the differences in accuracy throughout this process. I found that TF-IDF worked the best for me, although, still none of the performed particularly well. 

All models were significantly overfit, and suffered from being unbalanced. 

# Conclusion 

It's hard to trian computers to tell the difference between satire and real life.
